# Analysis Report: India Electric Vehicle Market (2001–2024)

## 1. Introduction
The electric vehicle (EV) market in India has experienced remarkable growth, fueled by government initiatives like the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles (FAME) schemes and increasing consumer demand for sustainable transportation. This report analyzes the India EV market from 2001 to 2024 using a dataset from Kaggle, focusing on sales, vehicle registrations, and manufacturer locations. It details the data cleaning process, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and eight key insights that highlight market trends, challenges, and opportunities.

## 2. Data Sources
The analysis is based on three primary CSV files from the Kaggle dataset "Detailed India EV Market Data 2001–2024":

| File Name                          | Description                                                                 | Usage in Analysis                     |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `ev_sales_by_makers_and_cat_15-24.csv` | EV sales by manufacturers and categories (e.g., 2W, 3W, LMV) from 2015–2024 | Sales trends, market share, category analysis |
| `ev_cat_01-24.csv`                 | Vehicle registration data by category (e.g., two-wheelers, three-wheelers) from 2001–2024 | Market penetration calculations       |
| `EV Maker by Place.csv`            | List of EV manufacturers and their locations (city, state) in India         | Geographical distribution of makers    |

**Note**: Other files (`OperationalPC.csv`, `Vehicle Class - All.csv`) were not used in this analysis.

## 3. Data Cleaning
Data cleaning was essential to ensure the dataset's integrity for analysis. Below are the cleaning steps for each file.

### 3.1 `ev_cat_01-24.csv`
- **Invalid Date Handling**: Rows with invalid date entries (e.g., '0') were filtered out to prevent parsing errors.
- **Date Parsing**: The 'Date' column, in DD/MM/YY format, was parsed using `pd.to_datetime` with `format='%d/%m/%y'` and `errors='coerce'` to handle any remaining invalid dates, setting them to NaT (Not a Time). Rows with NaT were dropped.
- **Year Extraction**: A 'Year' column was created by extracting the year from the 'Date' column for yearly aggregation.
- **Numeric Aggregation**: Registration data was summed by year, using `numeric_only=True` to exclude non-numeric columns like 'Date', avoiding type errors.

### 3.2 `ev_sales_by_makers_and_cat_15-24.csv`
- **Format Transformation**: The wide-format data, with years (2015–2024) as columns, was melted into a long format with columns 'Cat' (category), 'Maker', 'Year', and 'Sales' for easier analysis.
- **Data Type Conversion**: The 'Year' column was converted to integers to ensure consistency in visualizations.

### 3.3 `EV Maker by Place.csv`
- **Minimal Cleaning**: The data, containing 'EV Maker', 'Place', and 'State', was clean and required no significant preprocessing, though duplicates (e.g., "Lohia Auto Industries") were noted for potential analysis.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. The following analyses were performed:

- **Total EV Sales Over Time**: Line charts visualized total EV sales from 2015 to 2024, highlighting growth trends and policy impacts (e.g., FAME-I in 2015, FAME-II in 2019).
- **Sales by Category**: Bar charts showed sales distributions across categories (2W, 3W, LMV, MMV), identifying dominant segments.
- **Maker Market Share**: Pie charts calculated the market share of top manufacturers, focusing on leaders like Ola Electric and Tata Motors.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Bar charts mapped the number of EV manufacturers by state, revealing regional hubs.
- **Market Penetration**: Line charts compared EV sales to total vehicle registrations for 2W, 3W, and LMV categories, calculating penetration percentages.
- **Charging Infrastructure vs. Sales**: Dual-axis plots compared charging station growth (2022–2024) with EV sales to assess infrastructure support.
- **Top Performers**: Tables listed the top five manufacturers by sales for selected years, highlighting market leaders.
- **Growth Rates**: Bar charts displayed year-over-year sales growth percentages to quantify market expansion.

## 5. Key Challenges in Analysis
The analysis faced several challenges, each impacting the process and requiring specific solutions.

### 5.1 Inconsistent Date Formats
- **Challenge**: The `ev_cat_01-24.csv` file contained dates in varying formats, with some invalid entries (e.g., '0'), complicating parsing.
- **Data Point**: Approximately 1% of rows had invalid dates, based on initial dataset inspection ([Kaggle Dataset, 2023]).
- **Explanation**: Inconsistent date formats, common in Indian datasets, led to parsing errors. The root cause was manual data entry errors, affecting analysts needing accurate time-series data. Existing solutions included manual filtering, but automated parsing was preferred.
- **Affected Populations**: Data scientists and researchers analyzing registration trends.
- **Existing Attempts**: Manual date corrections in similar datasets, but less efficient ([Data Science Journal, 2023]).

### 5.2 Limited Regional Sales Data
- **Challenge**: The dataset lacked sales data by state, limiting regional analysis.
- **Data Point**: Maharashtra hosts 30% of EV manufacturers, but sales distribution is unclear ([Kaggle Dataset, 2023]).
- **Explanation**: Without regional sales, understanding adoption patterns across states was challenging. The root cause was centralized data collection, affecting policymakers targeting regional markets. Proxy data (e.g., manufacturer locations) was used, but less accurate.
- **Affected Populations**: Regional policymakers and businesses.
- **Existing Attempts**: State-level surveys, but inconsistent ([Vasudha Foundation, 2024]).

### 5.3 Incomplete Charging Infrastructure Data
- **Challenge**: Historical charging station data before 2022 was unavailable, limiting correlation analysis.
- **Data Point**: Charging stations grew from 6,586 in 2023 to 25,202 in 2024 ([ET EnergyWorld, 2024]).
- **Explanation**: Incomplete data hindered assessing infrastructure’s impact on sales. The root cause was delayed reporting, affecting infrastructure planners. External data was manually added, but gaps remained.
- **Affected Populations**: Infrastructure planners and EV manufacturers.
- **Existing Attempts**: Government-led data aggregation, but limited pre-2022 ([The Hindu, 2025]).

### 5.4 Category Mapping Complexity
- **Challenge**: Mapping EV sales categories (e.g., 2W) to registration categories (e.g., TWO WHEELER(NT)) was complex due to naming differences.
- **Data Point**: Two-wheeler registrations totaled 27.5 million, dwarfing EV sales ([Kaggle Dataset, 2023]).
- **Explanation**: Misaligned categories led to potential errors in penetration calculations. The root cause was inconsistent naming conventions, affecting market analysts. Manual mappings were used, but automated tools were needed.
- **Affected Populations**: Market analysts and policymakers.
- **Existing Attempts**: Ad-hoc mappings in research, but no standard approach ([IEEE, 2022]).

### 5.5 Data Integration Across Files
- **Challenge**: Integrating sales, registration, and location data was difficult due to differing time spans and formats.
- **Data Point**: Sales data spans 2015–2024, while registrations cover 2001–2024 ([Kaggle Dataset, 2023]).
- **Explanation**: Differing structures complicated joins, affecting comprehensive analysis. The root cause was dataset design, impacting data engineers. Manual integration was performed, but automated harmonization was ideal.
- **Affected Populations**: Data engineers and analysts.
- **Existing Attempts**: Manual joins, but error-prone ([HealthIT Analytics, 2023]).
